About dataset:
V1 to v28 are the transactions
Amount denotes the amount of transaction
Class is the factor variable  (0 denotes legit and 1 denotes fraud)
Time is the time of transaction.
Algorithms used :
1.Decision Tree
2. KNN
3.Logistic Regression
conclusion:
Decision Tree :0.9993288955797798
KNN :  0.9970253750022673
Logistic Regression : 0.9992382057932636
So, here we can conclude that in these three algorithms we can use any one algorithm to model our data.
